A simple website to describe tax brackets and calculate effective tax rate

## 3 Tips
1. Getting a raise or making more money does not reduce your take home pay even if you are in a "higher tax bracket". Any income you make below the new tax bracket are taxed in lower rates.
2. You belong to 1 or more tax brackets. If you are in the 28% tax bracket, you are paying taxes at 10%, 15%, 25% and 28%. You only pay taxes at 28% for each dollar you make at and over $90,751 (single), or $151,201 (married/joint/widowed), or $76,601 (married/separate), or $129,601 (head of household).
3. Your effective tax rate in percentage can be calculated using this formula: (total tax paid / annual income) * 100.
